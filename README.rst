Introduction
============

Get proper widgets for your Plone content types by registering default widgets.

It uses `collective.z3cform.widgets`.


Reasons for using this?
-----------------------

You are lazy like me and you don't want to do `this <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.contenttypes#how-to-override-widgets>`_ for each of your plone sites.

So, if you are using Plone < 5 and you still want to have nice widgets, especially for those fields that are important and have no proper widget, like `Subject`, you can use this package :)


Registered widgets
------------------

* subject / tags field => token input widget
